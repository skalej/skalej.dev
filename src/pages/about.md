I design and deliver event-driven backend systems that automate complex operational workflows at scale.

With 15+ years of experience across finance and large-scale e-commerce, I focus on translating ambiguous business requirements into reliable, observable, and maintainable systems. My work spans policy-driven services, asynchronous processing patterns, and cloud-native automation.

At Wayfair (Berlin), I worked on the Notifications and Supplier Actions platform, helping decouple legacy PHP workflows into event-driven microservices using Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Google Cloud. 

Key initiatives included:

- Migrating supplier email workflows from a legacy monolith to an event-based architecture, improving observability and enabling infrastructure decommissioning.
- Onboarding Google Cloud Tasks to power reminder and auto-closing workflows, reducing manual supplier action handling.
- Designing the VAS Overpack policy system — a configurable packaging preference service integrated into fulfillment workflows.

## How I Think About Systems

I care about:

- Clear service boundaries
- Deterministic workflow behavior
- Failure handling and retries
- Observability (metrics, dashboards, postmortems)
- Pragmatic trade-offs over theoretical purity

I enjoy leading initiatives from architecture through delivery — structuring execution, aligning teams, and shipping systems safely.

## Writing & Technical Notes

This site contains longer versions of my LinkedIn posts, where I write about:

- Backend architecture and distributed systems
- Event-driven workflows and automation
- Reliability and failure handling in production systems
- Practical implementations and design trade-offs
- Learning and experimenting with AI technologies, including LLM-based workflows and their role in modern system design

## Current Focus

I’m currently building a deterministic validation pipeline for German E-Invoices (XRechnung / ZUGFeRD), focused on explainable findings, idempotent processing, and audit-friendly workflows.
