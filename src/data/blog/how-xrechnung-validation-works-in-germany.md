Germany mandates structured e-invoicing for public-sector suppliers and is rapidly expanding requirements to B2B transactions. The two dominant formats — **XRechnung** and **ZUGFeRD** — both follow the European EN 16931 standard, but validating them correctly is more nuanced than running an XML schema check.

This post explains what XRechnung validation actually involves, where invoices commonly fail, and why technical validity alone is not enough for real-world accounting workflows.

## Table of contents

## What is XRechnung?

XRechnung is Germany's national implementation of the European e-invoicing standard EN 16931. It defines a set of business rules on top of two underlying XML syntaxes:

- **UBL (Universal Business Language)** — the more widely used syntax internationally
- **CII (Cross Industry Invoice)** — the UN/CEFACT syntax, common in German and French implementations

Both carry the same semantic content (invoice number, dates, parties, totals, VAT breakdowns) but use different XML structures and namespaces. A validator must handle both.

**ZUGFeRD** is a related format: a PDF/A-3 document with an embedded XML payload. The XML inside a ZUGFeRD PDF is either UBL or CII, so once extracted, the same validation logic applies.

## The three layers of validation

Most people think of validation as "does the XML parse correctly?" In practice, there are three distinct layers, and invoices can fail at any of them.

### Layer 1: Structural validity

The XML must be well-formed and use the correct root element and namespaces. A UBL invoice uses `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-2`, while a CII invoice uses `urn:un:unece:uncefact:data:standard:CrossIndustryInvoice:100`. Getting this wrong means the document isn't recognized as an e-invoice at all.

For ZUGFeRD, there's an additional step: the XML must actually be embedded in the PDF. Not every PDF that looks like an invoice contains structured data — scanned PDFs without embedded XML are a common source of confusion.

### Layer 2: Field-level and arithmetic checks

Even with valid structure, invoices frequently have issues with:

- **Missing mandatory fields** — invoice number, issue date, currency code, supplier name, and buyer name are all required. In practice, buyer name is the most commonly omitted field.
- **VAT arithmetic** — the sum of VAT breakdown amounts must match the declared VAT total. Rounding differences across line items are a frequent source of mismatches, especially in invoices with multiple tax rates.
- **VAT breakdown consistency** — if the invoice declares a non-zero VAT total, it must include a breakdown by tax rate. Missing breakdowns are a common error in CII invoices generated by smaller ERP systems.
- **Date consistency** — issue date, due date, and service period should be logically consistent. An invoice with a due date before the issue date will pass schema validation but indicates a data quality problem.

### Layer 3: Business and policy checks

This is where most real-world rejections happen. An invoice can be structurally valid and arithmetically correct but still fail during booking because:

- A **buyer reference** (Leitweg-ID for public-sector invoices, or an internal reference for corporate buyers) is missing
- A required **purchase order number** is absent
- The invoice references a **vendor not in the buyer's master data**, or the vendor's IBAN has changed since the last invoice
- **Payment terms** on the invoice don't match what's agreed in the contract
- The invoice amount deviates from a **recurring contract fee** without explanation

These are not XRechnung schema errors. They're operational readiness problems that cause invoices to bounce between accounting, procurement, and suppliers — sometimes for weeks.

## Common validation errors in practice

Based on the XRechnung specification and common ERP output patterns, certain errors appear repeatedly across invoice samples:

| Error | Frequency | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Missing buyer reference | Very common | Blocks public-sector processing entirely |
| VAT breakdown sum mismatch | Common | Accounting system rejects the invoice |
| Missing supplier VAT ID | Occasional | Cannot match to vendor master |
| Due date before issue date | Occasional | Data quality flag |
| Wrong currency code format | Rare | Parse failure |

The high-frequency errors are almost never caught by schema validation. They require field-level and policy-level checks.

## What public validators don't check

Germany provides public validation tools (like the KoSIT validator) that check XRechnung conformance against the official schematron rules. These are useful — they catch structural and schema-level issues reliably.

But public validators stop at technical conformance. They answer "is this a valid XRechnung?" — not "is this invoice ready for our accounting workflow?" The gap between the two is where most operational problems live:

- **Buyer references and PO numbers** — public validators don't know your organization's policies. A missing Leitweg-ID or internal reference number won't trigger a finding in schema validation, but it will block processing in your accounting system.
- **Vendor identity** — is this supplier in your vendor master? Has their IBAN changed since the last invoice? Schema validation has no concept of vendor matching or identity risk.
- **Contract terms** — does the invoiced amount match the agreed recurring fee? Are the payment terms consistent with the contract? This is entirely outside the scope of e-invoice standards.
- **Correction and storno chains** — if a correction invoice supersedes an original, the public validator treats both as independent valid documents. It won't tell you that the original should no longer appear in your books.
- **Cross-invoice context** — has this exact invoice been uploaded before? Is the same setup fee being charged a second time? Schema validation sees each invoice in isolation.

For a Kanzlei processing invoices for dozens of mandants, each with their own policies, vendor relationships, and contracts, the gap between "schema-valid" and "process-ready" is where the real work happens.

## Why deterministic validation matters

For Kanzlei offices (tax advisory firms) processing invoices for dozens of mandants (clients), validation must be **deterministic**: the same invoice with the same rules must always produce the same findings. This matters because:

- Audit trails require reproducibility
- Re-processing an invoice after a rule update should produce explainably different results, not random variation
- Batch operations across mandants must be consistent

This means validation rules need to be **versioned**. When a rule is added or changed, the version increments, and each invoice records which rule version was applied. Re-processing uses the new version and creates a new evaluation — the old one is preserved for audit.

## Schema validation is necessary but not sufficient

The takeaway: XRechnung/ZUGFeRD schema validation catches structural problems, but most invoice rejections in real workflows are caused by missing references, policy violations, or commercial mismatches that schema validation doesn't cover.

A practical validation system needs all three layers — structural, field-level arithmetic, and business/policy checks — applied deterministically and with clear evidence for every finding.

This is the problem I built [RechnungRadar](/projects/rechnungradar/) to solve. It runs the full validation pipeline on every incoming invoice and produces actionable findings before the invoice reaches DATEV or an ERP system — so that clarification loops happen once, not repeatedly.
